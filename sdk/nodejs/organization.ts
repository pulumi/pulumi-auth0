/**
 * The Organizations feature represents a broad update to the Auth0 platform that
 * allows our business-to-business (B2B) customers to better manage their partners
 * and customers, and to customize the ways that end-users access their
 * applications. Auth0 customers can use Organizations to:
 *
 *   - Represent their business customers and partners in Auth0 and manage their
 *     membership.
 *   - Configure branded, federated login flows for each business.
 *   - Build administration capabilities into their products, using Organizations
 *     APIs, so that those businesses can manage their own organizations.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as auth0 from "@pulumi/auth0";
 *
 * const acme = new auth0.Organization("acme", {
 *     displayName: "Acme Inc.",
 *     branding: {
 *         logoUrl: "https://acme.com/logo.svg",
 *         colors: {
 *             primary: "#e3e2f0",
 *             page_background: "#e3e2ff",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     connections: [{
 *         connectionId: auth0_connection.acme.id,
 *         assignMembershipOnLogin: true,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Existing organizations can be imported using organization id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import auth0:index/organization:Organization acme org_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 * ```
