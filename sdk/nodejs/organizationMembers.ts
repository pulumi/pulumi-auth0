/**
 * This resource is used to manage members of an organization.
 *
 * !> This resource manages all the members assigned to an organization. In contrast, the `auth0.OrganizationMember`
 * resource only appends a member to an organization. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this
 * resource in conjunction with the `auth0.OrganizationMember` resource when managing members for the same organization
 * id.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as auth0 from "@pulumi/auth0";
 *
 * const user1 = new auth0.User("user_1", {
 *     connectionName: "Username-Password-Authentication",
 *     email: "myuser1@auth0.com",
 *     password: "MyPass123$",
 * });
 * const user2 = new auth0.User("user_2", {
 *     connectionName: "Username-Password-Authentication",
 *     email: "myuser2@auth0.com",
 *     password: "MyPass123$",
 * });
 * const myOrg = new auth0.Organization("my_org", {
 *     name: "some-org",
 *     displayName: "Some Organization",
 * });
 * const myMembers = new auth0.OrganizationMembers("my_members", {
 *     organizationId: myOrg.id,
 *     members: [
 *         user1.id,
 *         user2.id,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource can be imported by specifying the organization ID.
 *
 * # 
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import auth0:index/organizationMembers:OrganizationMembers my_org_members "org_XXXXX"
 * ```
