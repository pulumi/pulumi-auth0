/**
 * This resource is used to manage the assignment of members and their roles within an organization.
 *
 * !> This resource appends a member to an organization. In contrast, the `auth0.OrganizationMembers` resource manages
 * all the members assigned to an organization. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in
 * conjunction with the `auth0.OrganizationMembers` resource when managing members for the same organization id.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as auth0 from "@pulumi/auth0";
 *
 * const user = new auth0.User("user", {
 *     email: "test-user@auth0.com",
 *     connectionName: "Username-Password-Authentication",
 *     emailVerified: true,
 *     password: "MyPass123$",
 * });
 * const myOrg = new auth0.Organization("my_org", {
 *     name: "org-admin",
 *     displayName: "Admin",
 * });
 * const myOrgMember = new auth0.OrganizationMember("my_org_member", {
 *     organizationId: myOrg.id,
 *     userId: user.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource can be imported by specifying the
 * organization ID and user ID separated by "::" (note the double colon)
 * <organizationID>::<userID>
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import auth0:index/organizationMember:OrganizationMember my_org_member "org_XXXXX::auth0|XXXXX"
 * ```
