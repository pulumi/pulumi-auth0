/**
 * Actions are secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.
 *
 * > An action bound to a trigger cannot be deleted. To destroy such an action, the trigger binding must first be deleted.
 * A binding is usually managed by auth0.TriggerAction resource.
 * The provider also supports a 1:many variant auth0_trigger_actions.
 * If by any means, a binding is missing is the state file, it can be imported to the state and deleted, before attempting to delete the action.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource can be imported by specifying the action ID.
 *
 * # 
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import auth0:index/action:Action my_action "12f4f21b-017a-319d-92e7-2291c1ca36c4"
 * ```
 *
 * ~> For security reasons importing `secrets` is not allowed. Therefore, it is advised to import
 *
 * the action without secrets and adding them back after the action has been imported.
