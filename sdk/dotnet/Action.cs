    /// Actions are secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.
    /// 
    /// &gt; An action bound to a trigger cannot be deleted. To destroy such an action, the trigger binding must first be deleted.
    /// A binding is usually managed by auth0.TriggerAction resource.
    /// The provider also supports a 1:many variant auth0_trigger_actions.
    /// If by any means, a binding is missing is the state file, it can be imported to the state and deleted, before attempting to delete the action.

    /// &gt; Values provided in the sensitive values shall be stored in the raw state as plain text: secrets.
